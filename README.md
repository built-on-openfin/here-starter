## What version does this branch cover?

## Before you get started

Read more about our [recommended development environment](https://developers.openfin.co/of-docs/docs/set-up-your-dev-environment).

Here Enterprise Browser is currently **only supported on Windows**.

We recommend:

- Using [Node.Js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)
- Using [RVM 7+](https://developer.openfin.co/versions/?product=RVM) - The RVM should auto update so this applies to environments where a specific RVM version is used.
- Running [OpenFin Health Check](https://cdn.openfin.co/health/deployment/index.html) - Load this page to see if you will be able to install/run Here without issue.
- Installing [OpenFin Process Manager](https://start.openfin.co/pm) - Install the OpenFin process manager application (this will let you debug any issues you might have with running this repo or your changes)
- Cloning this repo using: **git clone <https://github.com/built-on-openfin/here-starter.git> --depth=1** - the main branch will always reflect the latest stable release.
- Opening the root here-starter folder in Visual Studio Code (instead of opening a how-to subfolder directly in Visual Studio Code) - this will give you access to all the samples.
- Running **npm install** from the root folder
- Running **npm run build** from the root folder - this will ensure every sample has all of it's dependencies and builds correctly
